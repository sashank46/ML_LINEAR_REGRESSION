# Linear Regression Model
## Objective
The objective of this project is to build a simple Linear Regression model to predict a numerical value based on a single feature.

## Dataset
- A small dataset with two columns:
- X: Feature (independent variable)
- y: Target variable (dependent variable)
 ## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

## Installation
To install the required libraries, you can use pip:

--> (pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib)
##Implementation
Data Preparation: Created a small dataset and converted it into a DataFrame.

##Model Training:
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Created and trained a Linear Regression model using the training data.

##Model Evaluation:
Evaluated the model using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ² Score.

##Visualization:
Plotted the regression line along with the data points.
